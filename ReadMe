Here is the documentation of the app till now we have the Home Page

First run npm install to install all the packeges we are using 
Second run npm run dev
Then the app will start on the IP/Port http://127.0.0.1:5173 here you can see the app running

Note: This is using the Vite Js Configuration to make the React app light weight and Optomized


Only the src folder is important we go through all the files and folder in src

1. assets where we put the images 
2. components where we have the all component that make up the Home Page like Parts of Home Page
6. App.jsx which is the second Parent of the entire app where we put all the pages/components
7. main.jsx where is the ultimate Parent of the entire app 
8. all the files with .css are for the styling purposes
